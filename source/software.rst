Software Tools
==============

Here we introduce the tools used in this module and provide instructions for getting them set up to perform the tasks in this module.

MAP Client
----------

The Musculoskeletal Atlas Project Client (MAP Client) is an open-source cross-platform framework for managing workflows.  A workflow, as far as MAP Client is concerned, consists of a number of connected workflow steps.  The MAP Client framework is a plugin-based application where the plugins are workflow steps.  MAP Client is a Python based application which makes use of the Qt widget library.

Documentation for the project can be found at `MAP Client documentation <https://map-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

MAP Client is available to download from `MAP Client download <https://github.com/MusculoskeletalAtlasProject/mapclient/releases>`_

To get the best out of the MAP Client you will need to get some plugins, by default the MAP Client comes with five basic plugins.  A collection of available plugins can be found at `MAP Client plugins <https://github.com/mapclient-plugins>`_.

OpenCOR
-------

Instructions for obtaining and using `OpenCOR <http://opencor.ws/>`_ are covered in the :ref:`cellml_opencor_pmr_tutorial_index`.

OpenCMISS-Neon
--------------

OpenCMISS-Neon is a frontend application for the simulation and visualisation of finite element models.  This application is currently under development working towards a version 1.0.0.  The application is avaiable from `OpenCMISS-Neon <https://github.com/OpenCMISS/neon>`_ in source form only.
   
OpenCMISS-Iron & OpenCMISS-Zinc
-------------------------------

OpenCMISS-Iron the computational engine and OpenCMISS-Zinc the visualisation engine are at the heart of most of the OpenCMISS collection of software tools are available from `OpenCMISS.org <opencmiss.org>`_.  They are also available separately for simulating and visualising computational models.  Both of these software libraries come with Python bindings to enable the creation of bespoke applications.
