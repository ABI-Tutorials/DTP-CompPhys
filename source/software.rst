MAP Client
----------

The Musculoskeletal Atlas Project Client (MAP Client) is an open-source cross-platform framework for managing workflows.  A workflow, as far as MAP Client is concerned, consists of a number of connected workflow steps.  The MAP Client framework is a plugin-based application where the plugins are workflow steps.  MAP Client is a Python based application which makes use of the Qt widget library.

Documentation for the project can be found at `MAP Client documentation <https://map-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

MAP Client is available to download from `MAP Client download <https://github.com/MusculoskeletalAtlasProject/mapclient/releases>`_

To get the best out of the MAP Client you will need to get some plugins, by default the MAP Client comes with five basic plugins.  A collection of available plugins can be found at `MAP Client plugins <https://github.com/mapclient-plugins>`_.
