Introduction to (ODE) Modelling Best Practices
==============================================

In this series of tutorials we demonstrate some modelling practices that we recommend you follow when developing any mathematical model. The key principles are modularity, reuse, and reproducibility - we demonstrate those here using the tool `OpenCOR <http://opencor.ws>`_ and the `CellML <http://cellml.org>`_ and `SED-ML <http://sed-ml.org>`_ exchange formats, but the principles are valid across the spectrum of computational physiology.
