Introduction to (ODE) Modelling Best Practices
==============================================

In this series of tutorials we demonstrate some modelling practices that we recommend you follow when developing any mathematical model. The key principles are modularity and reuse - we demonstrate those here using the tool `OpenCOR <http://opencor.ws>`_ and the `CellML <http://cellml.org>`_ exchange format, but the principles are valid across the spectrum of computational physiology.

For the actual DTP the tutorial will be part of this documentation, but for the May 2015 trial run the tutorial is available in this :download:`PDF document </_static/OpenCOR Tutorial v8.pdf>`. If you do not already have OpenCOR installed, the tutorial will lead you through the process of downloading and installing OpenCOR.
