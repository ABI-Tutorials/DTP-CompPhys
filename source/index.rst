Overview
********

The topics in this section contain information to help you get started to explore a selection of the methods used by scientists in the MedTech CoRE working in the field of computational physiology - the application of engineering and mathematical sciences to the study of physiology.

This series of tutorials will first guide you through the main steps in a "standard" clinical workflow that takes advantage of computational physiology: *image processing*, *model building*, *simulation*, and *visualisation*. You will then be led through the development and implementation of a complete clinically focused workflow which will take advantage of the skills you have developed in the earlier modules. In demonstrating each of these steps we make use of examples for various organ systems being investigated under the MedTech CoRE. Each session will begin with a introductory lecture from a scientist working on the example organ system for that session who will present current research relevant to the MedTech CoRE. 

Following the clinical workflow tutorials we venture deeper into the world of standards and repositories to explore their importance in enabling the reproducibility and reusability of computational models as used in the clinical workflow tutorials. Latest research methods in the contruction and management of these computational models will be presented and time devoted to *playing* with these methods in order to emphasise the importance of reuse and reproducibility in the computational physiology domain.

Finally, several mini-projects are offered for students to work through on their own or in groups. These projects will collectively demonstrate the application of all the previous material in *real life* scientific research scenarios.

In addition to the material above, we provide here some further material that is relevant to this module. This includes the PMR user documentation and a tutorial introducing CellML, OpenCOR, and PMR.
