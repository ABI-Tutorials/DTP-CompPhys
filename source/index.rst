DTP: Computational Physiology
=============================

Welcome to the Computational Physiology module of the Doctoral Training Programme from the `MedTech CoRE <http://cmdt.org.nz>`_. In this series of tutorials, you will be exposed to a selection of the methods used by scientists in the MedTech CoRE working in the field of computational physiology - the application of engineering and mathematical sciences to the study of physiology.

This series of tutorials will first guide you through the main steps in a "standard" clinical workflow that takes advantage of computational physiology: image processing, geometric model building, simulation, and visualisation. You will be led through the development and implementation of a complete clinically focused workflow which will take advantage of the skills you have developed in the earlier modules. Finally, the course ends with an introduction to some of the key tools that are used in this field locally.
