MSK Workflow Demonstration
==========================

In the actual DTP Computational Physiology module, this section of the module would lead the students through the assembly of a comprehensive MSK workflow. Leading from clinical images through to some kind of kinematic model, visualisation, and output to some clinically relevant observations/interface.

For the May 2015 trial run, we will not be presenting this part of the Computational Physiology module.
