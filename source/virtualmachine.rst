DTP CP Virtual Machine
======================

For the May 2015 trial run of the Computational Physiology module, we provide a `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ `virtual machine <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Virtualization>`_ that contains all the tools and documentation required to participate in the module. Getting participants up and running with the virtual machine requires you to :menuselection:`Machine --> Add` the provided virtual machine - but the tutors are on hand to help with this.

Some useful things to note regarding the provided virtual machine are provided below.

* The default username is ``abi`` with the password ``abipassword``.
* `OpenCOR <http://opencor.ws>`_ is installed and can be launched via the shortcut on the desktop.
